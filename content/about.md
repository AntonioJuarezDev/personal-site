My name is Antonio Ju√°rez; I'm a web developer.

I like listening to classical music (although I listen to many other musical genres) and reading mystery novels like **And Then There Were None** by Agatha Christie.

Another thing I enjoy is watching anime; my favourites are **Hyouka**, **Spice and Wolf**, **Puella Magi Madoka Magica** and **Steins;Gate**.

This blog is where I share the things I learn or experience; if you like the content I post and want to discuss it, send me a message to antoniojuarez.dev@gmail.com

Thank you for reading.
